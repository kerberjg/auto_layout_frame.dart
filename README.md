- 💻 **Production-ready boilerplate**: complete starting point for a high-quality Dart package


## ✨ Features
- Unopinionated! A minimal example focused on compliance with Dart guidelines
- Ready for immediate package publication to [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/)
- Pre-configured `pubspec.yaml` with recommended fields
- Multiple example projects in the `example/` directory
- Linting setup with `lints` package for code quality, following the [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) style guide
- (Recommended) [MPL-2.0 License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MPL-2.0) for open source projects
- Unit tests setup with `test` package
- GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing/QA jobs on push events and PRs

This repository is also published as a package on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_package_template) to make sure it's always kept up to date on the most recent best practices 🫶

#### Coming up next:
- GitHub **Issue/PR templates**
- **CLI utility** for maintenance/updates (separate repo/package)

## 🔮 Usage Guide

### Getting Started

1. **Create a new repository**
    - Click the "Use this template" button on the GitHub page for this repository.
    - Fill in the details for your new repository and create it.
        - **🛑✋ IMPORTANT!** Make sure to name your new repository and package with underscore separators, **`just_like_this`** as required by Dart.
2. **Clone your new repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <your-repo-name>
    ```
3. **Update `pubspec.yaml`**
    - Change the `name`, `description`, `homepage`, `repository`, and `issue_tracker` fields to match your package
    - Update the `environment` SDK constraints if necessary
    - Update the same fields in `example/**/pubspec.yaml`
4. **Rename the entrypoint file** `lib/dart_package_template.dart` to `lib/<your_package_name>.dart` - this is required by Dart package conventions
5. **Update `README.md`**
    - We recommend you keep the sections, titles and the structure of this README as-is
    - Update the content to reflect your package's purpose, features, and usage
    - Update the badges at the top to reflect your repository and package details
6. **Update `LICENSE`**
    - We recommend the included [`MPL-2.0 License`](https://opensource.org/licenses/MPL-2.0) for open source packages, as it's business-friendly and allows for both open source and proprietary use
    - If you choose a different license, make sure to update the `LICENSE` file accordingly

### Development & Maintenance

1. Make sure you have the following enabled in your IDE:
    - Dart SDK
    - Dart/Flutter Linting
    - "Format on Save"
2. **Write your code!** implement your package functionality in `lib/`, however you like 💙
    - Make sure there are no format/analysis issues reported by your IDE!
3. **Update & run tests** to ensure everything is working as expected:
    ```bash
    dart test
    ```
4. **Commit & push your changes** to your repository. We recommend using a standardized branching strategy (such as [`GitFlow`](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)) and maintaining a cohesive commit message/history style.

5. **Create a Pull Request** to merge your changes into the `main` branch.
    - Make sure all **GitHub Actions** checks pass before merging
    - Once approved, merge the PR into `main`

6. **Review & Refine**
    - Regularly review your codebase for improvements, refactoring, and updates to dependencies
    - Keep your documentation up to date in `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`


### Publishing

1. **Commit the version bump**
    - Update the version in `pubspec.yaml` according to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
    - Update the `CHANGELOG.md` with the changes made in this version
        - 🤫 _psst!_ you can use [git log](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) command to help you with this, such as `git log --oneline --decorate 1.0.0..HEAD` to see all commits since version 1.0.0
    - Name the commit something like `Bump version to x.y.z`
    - Create a git tag for the new version: `git tag x.y.z`

2. **Publish to pub.dev**
    - **IMPORTANT:** Make sure you have an account on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/) and are logged in via the command line using `dart pub login`
    - First run `dart pub publish --dry-run` to ensure everything is ready for publication
    - If the above command reports any issues, address them before proceeding
    - When ready, run `dart pub publish` to publish your package

### Next steps

- Share your work! Announce your package on social media, relevant forums, and communities to gain users and feedback.
- Invite collaborators! Open your repository to contributions from others to help improve and maintain the package.
- Keep learning and improving! Regularly update your package with new features, bug fixes, and improvements based on user feedback.
